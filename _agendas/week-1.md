### Friday, Lab

- Introductions
- Discuss Git, GitHub Pages and navigating the terminal: [GitHub workshop](/workshops/lab/github)

### Homework

1. Read [The seven rules of a great git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)
1. Customize the index of your GitHub page. Use as much HTML/CSS/JavaScript
  as you feel comfortable with. Practice changing the file, committing it
  with a message, and pushing the changes to GitHub. Everyone should come to class
  on Week 2 with __at least 5__ additional commits logged. Make sure that your commit messages
  are short, descriptive and represent the changes you make, just like the seven rules
  recommends. You'll be using GitHub throughout the semester to post work online and
  save your coding progress, so it's important to feel comfortable with this process.
1. Add a link to your class survey completed in Thursday's studio class to your home page.
1. Read and/or review the following pages from w3schools. There will be a short quiz next week that tests your knowledge of the concepts outlined in these pages.
