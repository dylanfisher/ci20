### Friday, Lab

- Lecture [JavaScript Introduction](/workshops/lab/javascript-introduction)
- Discuss [JavaScript in 14 Minutes](https://jgthms.com/javascript-in-14-minutes/)
- In-class exercise and homework: [JavaScript Intro Exercise](/workshops/lab/javascript-intro-exercise)

### Homework

- Review [JavaScript in 14 Minutes](https://jgthms.com/javascript-in-14-minutes/) again. Follow the presentation slowly and read the descriptions of each component carefully. Try to absorb as much of this information
as possible. If you begin to understand the basics, it will make using JavaScript much more fun because you will be confident in how the underlying principles work.
