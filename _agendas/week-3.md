### Friday, Lab

- Exercise: [Coding from Life](/workshops/lab/coding-from-life)

### Homework

Add a link to your Coding from Life sketches to your website. The link should be easy to find from your home page. You'll continue to do this with each exercise throughout the semester.

If you did not finish the drawings in class, or you'd like to spend more time working on them, take a photo of the still life and complete it at home. If you weren't in class this week you'll need to create a still life of your own.

Create an archive of all the drawings completed in class, both your own drawings and the two drawings from each other student.
You can find each project from the [students](/students) page, in their github repos.

Store this archive in the your github projects directory, e.g. at this path `projects/coding-from-life-archive`. Your archives should consist
of a `index.html` and `main.css`, just like the Coding from Life sketches in the starter kit.

Your archives should link to each drawing directly. For example, if I had created a drawing, you would link to `http://fisherdm.github.io/projects/coding-from-life/sketch-1/index.html`.

You should consider how you choose to organize the drawings. Is it alphabetically, chronologically, by color, random, or something else?

You should consider how you display the drawings. Is it with an image of the sketch, or a more abstract representation of the sketch, or just text?

Once your archive is complete and correctly linked to each student's sketch, add a new link to your github pages home page page linking to the
archive, and to your two sketches.

### Homework

- IMPORTANT: We&rsquo;re going on a field trip to the [Cybernetics Library](https://cybernetics.social/) on Tuesday. Please meet at  424 W 54 Street at 9am. My phone number is 415-637-6299 in case anyone gets lost. Please come up with a few questions and [browse the archive](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/cyberneticslibrary) in advance.
- Due TUESDAY: Create a short presentation/PDF/google doc/dropbox paper that highlights a topic within visual culture/popular culture you'd like to investigate – try to be as specific as possible and reference [this video](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/tutorials/picking_topic) for guidance. Document your findings as well as look at for other interviews and articles on the topic. Once you&rsquo;ve selected your topic, research someone you can interview for the Zine project (have 2 back up plans, as well). Create a complete written draft of the questions you&rsquo;d like to ask them. Include research on who they are, how they contribute to your topic and any other information you can find about them. Save this in the google drive, I will review and send you feedback. Remember, this is not a book report – this can be considered a small research project that you will then develop a publication out of.
- Due THURSDAY: Read [The New Web Typography](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/the-new-web-typography) and write a discussion question. Discussion leader is Ani, please make sure to introduce Jan Tschichold (mentioned in reading) in your presentation.
