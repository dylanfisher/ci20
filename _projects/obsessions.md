### Overview

For this project, come up with a question you’d like to explore. Devise a plan to receive answers for the question and document the process. Possible ways of collecting information are, but aren’t limited to: interviewing people in the school or on the street; on Twitter; on Instagram; emailing a select audience, or posting a survey online. Aim to have as many answers as possible, but we’ll need at least 50 for the scope of the assignment. Once you have your answers, create a website to house this information.

1. Think about how you’ll present your findings. Are they organized, or disorganized?
2. Consider the hierarchy of your content – is the question and process important? How do they relate to your actual findings?
3. Consider how you’ll present your answers. With text? Images? Drawings? Photographs?
4. Consider how the user interacts with your archive, and how the archive is experienced. Is it immediately accessible in its entirety, or is the user required to discover it?
5. The project is required to have at least two views: a view at a glance, and a detailed view where you can explore specific entries and learn more information.
