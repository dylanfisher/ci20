### Overview
We’ve explored different ways that you can use the web for publishing, as a medium for art, storage, and organizing information. Now, let’s consider another difference between print and digital design – it’s live!
Not only is it easy to change and update digital work, you also have access to an entire community of data and people.
Let's take this idea and combine it with the natural world.
For this assignment, I'd like you to take a natural occuring phenomenon (for example: shadows, waves, moon cycles...) and reinterpret it online.
How can you create a website that changes, either with time or content? How can it represent the natural occurance but feel like a new visualization about it?
You can consider using a public API to generate part of the content, or find another solution to generate content that&rsquo;s out of your control.

Go back to our references for [evolving content](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Evolving-Content--AbFLwzLLILR~di7UsMUsiflPAQ-4GwTXZtD3CbcPUESw0Jj2). Think about how you can create a website that visualizes something out of your hands.
