### Overview
We’ve explored different ways that you can use the web for personal publishing, art, storage and reading. Now, let’s consider another difference between print and digital design – it’s live!
Not only is it easy to change and update digital work, you also have access to an entire community of data and people.
How can you create a website that changes, either with time or content?
You can consider using a public API to generate part of the content, or find another solution to generate content that&rsquo;s out of your control.

Go back to our references for [evolving content](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Evolving-Content--AbFLwzLLILR~di7UsMUsiflPAQ-4GwTXZtD3CbcPUESw0Jj2). Think about how you can create a website that visualizes something out of your hands.
