### Overview

Conduct an interview with someone who contributes to popular or visual culture in some way (this could be anyone who works in graphic design, media, or any adjacent profession). Use the contents of the interview to build a single edition issue of a digital zine. Your zine must include:

- A name for your zine
- The interview
- A combination of typography and graphics

All of the graphics included must be edited or created by you (i.e no stock or found images).

You’ll also need to print out your zine and you’ll work on creating a print stylesheet in lab to stylize this. Consider how both will adjust for the appropriate media.
